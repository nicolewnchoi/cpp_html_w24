        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Orange Chicken is a 2yr old brown tabby cat. She prefers to spend her
          days sleeping on the cat tower her butler has gifted her. When she is
          not lounging around, she also likes to play attack with her favorite
          rabbit toy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She loves her butler dearly that when any stranger or even her
          butler's loved ones attempts to approach her, she would either run
          away or hiss at them out of annoyance.

        <p>
          Smoothie has been dubbed the "world's most photogenic cat", and her
          emerald eyes and golden fur have even inspired a mural in New Zealand.
          Smoothie also has an aptly-named brother named Milkshake, and the two
          are often featured together across social media platforms.
